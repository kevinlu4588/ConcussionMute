## Audio Source Separation Using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

The task of single channel audio source separation, which consists in isolating the different audio sources present in a mixture signal. 
This can be used in several applications from distinguishing the different music instruments in an orchestra recording to speech
enhancement by separating relevant information of a speaker and the background noise.\


NMF techniques implemented from:
